## Development

### Changelog

Keeping `/CHANGELOG.md` up to date as new features are added make the release of new versions much simpler.

In addition, it gives a clear indication on what has been added/fixed/etc but not released yet.

### Documentation

The documentation is generated with [Doxygen](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) and can be used via the GUI or the CLI.

The configuration file can be found at `/Documentation/Doxyfile`. Unfortunately the paths are absolute and will depend on the developer machine.

To update the documentation, run `make doc_generate`. To preview it, run `make doc_serve` and visit `http://localhost:8000/`.
The documentation is generated into the `docs` directory with is configured to be served for `GitHub pages`.
Therefore the documentation is automatically published by just pushing the changes.
